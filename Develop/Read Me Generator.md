## Test:
By using bash commands in the terminal, a user opens the file for the read me generator. They can see there is currently no read me file. By entering the command: node index.js they are given a set of prompts to complete the Read Me sections. When the file has been created, a message displays with: “Read me done!” and you can see the new file created in the directory. You can then open the file and find sections are filled out with user inputs, formatted correctly and active links. Copy and save the file externally to use as a “good” read me.
